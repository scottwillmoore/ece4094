# Journal

This journal contains my weekly entries to record and reflect on my progress throughout the project. These entries will be also be copied and uploaded into Moodle at the end of each week.

## Week 01

_26-06-2021_

I have contacted Arthur and he has agreed to supervise my project.

The goal is to build a collaborative web-based circuit schematic capture and simulation package, which would ideally be a replacement for [LTspice](https://www.analog.com/en/design-center/design-tools-and-calculators/ltspice-simulator.html) which is frequently used by undergraduate students to learn, understand and simulate analog circuits. The software is closed-source, and in my opinion not very user-friendly. I believe an open-source, easily extendable and more user-friendly clone would be of significant practical use within the Monash community and other institutions.

I have also submitted my risk assessment for review on SARAH.

I have created a Git repository which can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/scottwillmoore/ece4094).

Finally, the majority of the work for the requirement analysis has already been completed from the previous semester, therefore the focus will be primarily devoted to building a functional minimum viable product.
