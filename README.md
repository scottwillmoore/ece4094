# ECE4094

## Overview

Collaborative circuit schematic capture and simulation with conflict-free
replicated data types.

## Technology

This project is currently built with Javascript and the
[React.js](https://reactjs.org/) library. It is expected that as the project
matures new technology may be adopted to implement server-side and other
requirements.

## Install

You must have the following pre-requisites installed:

-   [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

Then you must run the following commands:

```sh
# Download the git repository.
git clone git@github.com:scottwillmoore/ece4094.git

You may now edit and tweak files and in most cases they will automatically hot-reload.
